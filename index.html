                I am a Psychology major at Lehman college, and currently a Junior. I recently transferred from The City College of New York last year. I have not taken a programming course before, but I had minimal knowledge on the creation of web development. I once made a Wix page my Freshman year of college for my writing seminar. I chose to take <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/sfulakeza/">CMP 128</a> because I would like to extend my knowledge on how to make a website because I believe its important to understand how things work in the world we live in.

        My top 3 perfect jobs are being an industrial-organizational Psychologist, a mental health counselor, and a registered nurse. My career goal is to obtain my MA in Industrial-Organizational Psychology so I can begin a job in analyzing work environments. At first, I wanted to be a Registered Nurse but I had a deeper interest in Psychology in the business aspect. A mental health counselor is my second choice because mental health is one of the biggest health concerns all around the world. In this generation, there are a lot more concerns and careers surrounding mental health. While I was in highschool, I wanted to be in the medical field but I did not know where exactly. In my Freshman year of college, I decided to want to go into Nursing. Unfortunately and fortunately, taking my first Intro to Psychology course that year caused me to change majors.
